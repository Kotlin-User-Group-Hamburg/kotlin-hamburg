# Kotlin Hamburg Meetup

Meetings are announced 
on the [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/kotlin-user-group-hamburg/). Attendees need to
RSVP there.


Proposals
---------

Talk proposals should be created as issues. They should include a title 
and a short description of the talk. A hint about the level would be nice (beginner, intermediate, advanced) would be helpful.

Proposals should be assigned to the proposed speaker.

Please vote for talks by giving a üëç.
